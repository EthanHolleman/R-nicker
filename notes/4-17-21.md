# Nan Rlooper issues

Threw together this snakemake repo to test R-looper out on the footprinted
sequences as eventually would like to test by introducing nicks. 

Found that for all footprinted regions the program produces `Nan` for each
probability. I thought this might be due to some error in my fasta headers
that was causing an issue somewhere but that did not seem to be the issue.

Next I shortened one of the footprinted regions to 100 bp to see if
somehow the number of bases was effecting the outputs. This seems to be the case
as the outputs included numberic probabilities. 

`nan` in C++ are used to identify undefined or non-representable values for
floats such as square root of negative numbers or 0/0 - [c++ documentation](https://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cmath/nan-function/).

Since some of the probabilities where getting real small even in
the 100 bp trial it could be the second case. However, not sure
why this is happening now. During lab rotation I did encounter this
issue with longer sequences but only with very long ones I think. The sequences I was running averaged around 3000 bp. Very confused
about why that is going on.
